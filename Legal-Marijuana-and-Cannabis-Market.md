The medical cannabis segment remains one of the primary drivers, with countries like the United States, Canada, and several European nations expanding their medical cannabis programs. Recreational use is also contributing to market growth, particularly in regions like California, Colorado, and other states in the U.S., where cannabis consumption has become mainstream.</p> <p>Market growth is further supported by innovations in cannabis products such as edibles, oils, tinctures, and topicals, offering consumers a wider range of choices.
